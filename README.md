Explanation:

Function Definition: The function minimize_card_reissues_and_bins now calculates the total number of cards assigned to each 8-digit bin.
Objective Function: The reissuance cost is adjusted by subtracting the number of expiring cards from the total number of cards in each 6-digit bin.
Constraints: The constraints remain the same as before.
Cost Calculations: After solving the LP problem, we calculate the total reissuance cost, total active bin cost, and total cards assigned to each 8-digit bin based on the assignments and active bins.
Result Output: The final result includes the status, assignments, bins used, total reissuance cost, total active bin cost, and the total number of cards assigned to each 8-digit bin.
